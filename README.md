I decided to time the project. So I wanted to see how much I could get done in 2 hours.

Assignment:
- DONE! - Edit a task
- DONE! - Mark a task as complete
- DONE! - Have a basic user interface to view tasks
- DONE! - Store tasks in a database
- DONE! - Use Eloquent to interact with the database

If you found the above comfortable, the following optional extras would be nice to see:
- DONE! (Options: Hidden from main list, but shown in the "completed list" for visual) - Moving completed tasks to the end of the list ( or hide them )
- DONE! - Assigning deadline dates to tasks
- DONE! - Notify or display that a task is now overdue
- Time limit exceeded - Search for a task
